   Windows has the ability to set up port forwarding. This allows incoming traffic to
a local port to be redirected to another local port or a port on a remote computer. 
Port Proxy allows for services to use non-standard ports, for example RDP on port 3390 
rather than 3389. Additionally, it is not necessary for the system to have a service 
using the port. Port Proxy can be used to pivot between networks. Port Proxy supports
both IPv4 and IPv6.

Obtains the following information:
 - Listening IP Address and Port
 - Connect to IP Address and Port
