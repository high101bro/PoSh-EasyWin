Description:
The User Initialisation process is launched by WINLOGON, and sets up the user environment.

After running logon scripts and other startup tasks, USERINIT launches the shell process specified at HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\Winlogon\Shell.

Typically this is Explorer.exe, which then sets up your desktop, start menu or whatever else your version of Windows provides, as well as launching as any startup programs.

But this provides another way for malware to infect your system. Again, take a look if you’re in any doubt.

USERINIT should close down after launching the shell, which means it won’t appear on your task list (but it’s important enough that we’re listing it here anyway).
