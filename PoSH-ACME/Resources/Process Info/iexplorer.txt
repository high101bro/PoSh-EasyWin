Description:	Internet Explorer (IE) is a typical desktop applicaiton launched by a user. Such applicaitons will almost always be a child of explorer.exe. Modern versions of IE will have a sub-process for each open tab. It does this for several reasons, including enhanced security. When accessing an Internet site, IE will run the tab process with low integrity, which sandboxes the process, making it more difficult for attackers to modify sensitive areas of the registry or file system if they are able to compromise the IE child process. Attackers often name their malware iexplore.exe and place it in an alternate directory or misspell iexplore.exe as iexplorer.exe.
