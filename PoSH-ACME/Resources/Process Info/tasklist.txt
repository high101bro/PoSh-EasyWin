Description:
	The generic host process for Windows Tasks. This process was renamed to taskhostex.exe for Windows 8 and then to taskhostw.exe for Windows 10. Upon initialization, taskhost.exe runs a continuous loop listening for trigger events Example trigger events that can initiate a task include a defined schedule, user logon, system startup, idle CPU time, a Windows log event, workstation lock, or workstation unlock.
There are mote than 70 tasks preconfigured on a default installation of Windows 7 Enterprise (though many are disabled). For example, defrag.exe is scheduled to run against all volumes every Wednesday at 1:00 am. Another default task backs up the core registry hive files every 10 days. All executable files (DLLs & EXEs) used by the default Windows 7/8 scheduled tasks are signed by Microsoft.
