Description:	The system process is responsible for most kernel-mode threads. Modules run under system are primarily drivers (.sys files), but also several important DLLs as well as the kernel executable, ntoskrnl.exe.
These are created by the Windows kernel as your system starts. They're not regular processes -- they don't have an image name or an address space -- but it’s normal for them to generate CPU and other activity.
System Idle Process should have a PID (Process ID) of 0, System will be 4, and both will be running as SYSTEM (User will be displayed as NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM or just SYSTEM, depending what you’re using).
Neither System or System Idle Process have a parent, but System will be the parent for smss.exe and Interrupts.
Created by ntoskrnl.exe via the process manager function, which creates and terminates processes and threads.
No visible parent processes
System has a static PID of 4
System creates smss.exe
There should only be one system process running
