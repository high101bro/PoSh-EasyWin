Services, system subsystems, and applications rely on processes 
--- Are the binaries properly signed? 
--- Do they have handles to unexpected system resources? 
--- Does it have network access that make sense? 
--- Is the associative software installed on the host/target (McAfee process running...McAfee needs to be installed) --- 
Stand-alone services may have their own binaries
Some services are started by DLLs within svchost.exe 
--- DLL hosting processes. i.e. rundll32.exe 
--- Services that automatically start could be used for persistence
Drivers can be loaded by processes 
--- Some vendors will use their own folders 
--- Not all installed drivers are loaded
Privileges must be checked on each process 
Are multiple instances expected? 
--- LSASS.EXE 
--- CSRSS.EXE 
Historical differentials can show what has changed over a period of time
Parent / child relationship 
What user account the process is running under 
Is the spelling correct (check metadata as well)? 
The path of execution 
--- c:\windows\system32\svchost.exe 
--- c:\windows\svchost.exe 
Command line parameters 
Processes executing scripts 
Start time 
Whitelisted Hashes (Gold Images) 
Automated Reputation Analysis (Virus Total) 
Most scientifically, does it pass the eye test? 
--- Randomly generated filenames and directories
Windows 5.x
--- System Process (pid 4) 
--- smss.exe (Session Manager) 
--- csrss.exe (Windows Subsystem) 
--- winlogon.exe (Logon Process) 
--- services.exe (Service Control Manager) 
--- multiple svchost.exe’s 
--- lsass.exe (Local Security Authentication Server) 
--- explorer.exe  (Orphaned)
Windows 6.x
--- System Process (pid 4) 
--- smss.exe (Master instance) 
--- csrss.exe (Orphaned - One per session) 
--- wininit.exe (Orphaned) 
--- services.exe 
--- multiple svchost.exe’s 
--- lsass.exe 
--- lsm.exe 
--- winlogon.exe (Orphaned) 
--- explorer.exe  (Orphaned as always)
