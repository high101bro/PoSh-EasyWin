- System Monitor (Sysmon) is a Windows system service and device driver.
- Once installed on a system, remains resident across system reboots. 
- It monitors and logs system activity to the Windows event log. 
- Provides detailed information on process creations, network connections, and changes to file 
  creation time. 
- Using Windows Event Viewer or a SIEM, you can identify malicious or anomalous activity and 
  understand how intruders and malware operate on your network.
- Note that Sysmon does not provide analysis of the events it generates, nor does it attempt to
  protect or hide itself from attackers.

Sysmon includes the following capabilities:
- Logs process creation with full command line for both current and parent processes.
- Records the hash of process image files using SHA1 (the default), MD5, SHA256 or IMPHASH.
- Multiple hashes can be used at the same time.
- Includes a process GUID in process create events to allow for correlation of events even when
  Windows reuses process IDs.
- Include a session GUID in each events to allow correlation of events on same logon session.
- Logs loading of drivers or DLLs with their signatures and hashes.
- Logs opens for raw read access of disks and volumes
- Optionally logs network connections, including each connection’s source process, IP addresses,
  port numbers, hostnames and port names.
- Detects changes in file creation time to understand when a file was really created. Modification 
  of file create timestamps is a technique commonly used by malware to cover its tracks.
- Automatically reload configuration if changed in the registry.
- Rule filtering to include or exclude certain events dynamically.
- Generates events from early in the boot process to capture activity made by even sophisticated
  kernel-mode malware.

Sysmons creates the following Event IDs:
- Event ID 1: Process creation
  The process creation event provides extended information about a newly created process.
  The full command line provides context on the process execution. The ProcessGUID field is a unique
  value for this process across a domain to make event correlation easier. The hash is a full hash of
  the file with the algorithms in the HashType field.

- Event ID 2: A process changed a file creation time
  The change file creation time event is registered when a file creation time is explicitly modified
  by a process. This event helps tracking the real creation time of a file. Attackers may change the 
  file creation time of a backdoor to make it look like it was installed with the operating system. 
  Note that many processes legitimately change the creation time of a file; it does not necessarily 
  indicate maliciousactivity.

- Event ID 3: Network connection
  The network connection event logs TCP/UDP connections on the machine. It is disabled by default. 
  Each connection is linked to a process through the ProcessId and ProcessGUID fields. The event also 
  contains the source and destination host names IP addresses, port numbers and IPv6 status.

- Event ID 4: Sysmon service state changed
  The service state change event reports the state of the Sysmon service (started or stopped).

- Event ID 5: Process terminated
  The process terminate event reports when a process terminates. It provides the UtcTime, ProcessGuid 
  and ProcessId of the process.

- Event ID 6: Driver loaded
  The driver loaded events provides information about a driver being loaded on the system. The 
  configured hashes are provided as well as signature information. The signature is created 
  asynchronously for performance reasons and indicates if the file was removed after loading.

- Event ID 7: Image loaded
  The image loaded event logs when a module is loaded in a specific process. This event is disabled 
  by default and needs to be configured with the –l option. It indicates the process in which the 
  module is loaded, hashes and signature information. The signature is created asynchronously for 
  performance reasons and indicates if the file was removed after loading. This event should be 
  configured carefully, as monitoring all image load events will generate a large number of events.

- Event ID 8: CreateRemoteThread
  The CreateRemoteThread event detects when a process creates a thread in another process. This 
  technique is used by malware to inject code and hide in other processes. The event indicates the 
  source and target process. It gives information on the code that will be run in the new thread: 
  StartAddress, StartModule and StartFunction. Note that StartModule and StartFunction fields are 
  inferred, they might be empty if the starting address is outside loaded modules or known exported 
  functions.

- Event ID 9: RawAccessRead
  The RawAccessRead event detects when a process conducts reading operations from the drive using 
  the \\.\ denotation. This technique is often used by malware for data exfiltration of files that 
  are locked for reading, as well as to avoid file access auditing tools. The event indicates the 
  source process and target device.

- Event ID 10: ProcessAccess
  The process accessed event reports when a process opens another process, an operation that’s often 
  followed by information queries or reading and writing the address space of the target process. 
  This enables detection of hacking tools that read the memory contents of processes like Local 
  Security Authority (Lsass.exe) in order to steal credentials for use in Pass-the-Hash attacks. 
  Enabling it can generate significant amounts of logging if there are diagnostic utilities active 
  that repeatedly open processes to query their state, so it generally should only be done so with 
  filters that remove expected accesses.

- Event ID 11: FileCreate
  File create operations are logged when a file is created or overwritten. This event is useful for 
  monitoring autostart locations, like the Startup folder, as well as temporary and download 
  directories, which are common places malware drops during initial infection.

- Event ID 12: RegistryEvent (Object create and delete)
  Registry key and value create and delete operations map to this event type, which can be useful for 
  monitoring for changes to Registry autostart locations, or specific malware registry modifications.

  Sysmon uses abbreviated versions of Registry root key names, with the following mappings:
    Key name                                    Abbreviation
    HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE                          HKLM
    HKEY_USERS                                  HKU
    HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\System\ControlSet00x     HKLM\System\CurrentControlSet
    HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Classes                  HKCR

- Event ID 13: RegistryEvent (Value Set)
  This Registry event type identifies Registry value modifications. The event records the value 
  written for Registry values of type DWORD and QWORD.

- Event ID 14: RegistryEvent (Key and Value Rename)
  Registry key and value rename operations map to this event type, recording the new name of the key 
  or value that was renamed.

- Event ID 15: FileCreateStreamHash
  This event logs when a named file stream is created, and it generates events that log the hash 
  of the contents of the file to which the stream is assigned (the unnamed stream), as well as the 
  contents of the named stream. There are malware variants that drop executables or configuration
  settings via browser downloads, and this event is aimed at capturing that based on the browser 
  attaching a Zone.Identifier “mark of the web” stream.

- Event ID 17: PipeEvent (Pipe Created)
  This event generates when a named pipe is created. Malware often uses named pipes for interprocess 
  communication.

- Event ID 18: PipeEvent (Pipe Connected)
  This event logs when a named pipe connection is made between a client and a server.

- Event ID 19: WmiEvent (WmiEventFilter activity detected)
  When a WMI event filter is registered, which is a method used by malware to execute, this event
  logs the WMI namespace, filter name and filter expression.

- Event ID 20: WmiEvent (WmiEventConsumer activity detected)
  Logs the registration of WMI consumers, recording the consumer name, log, and destination.

- Event ID 21: WmiEvent (WmiEventConsumerToFilter activity detected)
  When a consumer binds to a filter, this event logs the consumer name and filter path.

- Event ID 22: DNSEvent (DNS query)
  This event generates when a process executes a DNS query, whether the result is successful or 
  fails, cached or not. The telemetry for this event was added for Windows 8.1 so it is not available 
  on Windows 7 and earlier.

- Event ID 255: Error
  This event is generated when an error occurred within Sysmon. They can happen if the system is 
  under heavy load and certain tasked could not be performed or a bug exists in the Sysmon service. 
  You can report any bugs on the Sysinternals forum or over Twitter (@markrussinovich).
